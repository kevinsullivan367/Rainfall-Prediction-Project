# Rainfall Prediction Project


This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the existence of rainfall on a given day using time series data.


**Project Goal:** Fit a model that is both accurate in predicting rainfall and parsimonious enough to be easily implemented by public agencies


**Methods Used:** Over 800,000 models run 

-> Logistic Regression
-> K-Nearest Neighbors
-> XG Boost
-> Random Forest
-> Forward, Backward, and Stepwise Selection
-> Lasso and Ridge Regression
-> 5 and 10 Fold Cross Validation
-> LDA, QDA, and Naive Bayes
-> Feature Engineering guided by a Literature Review



**Key Result:** Logistic regression model with 5-fold cross validation and only three predictors was accurate 90% of the time.
